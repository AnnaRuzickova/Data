The dataset Data_Microclimate_Species was used for the analyses described in paper section Data analysis - Bryophyte communities and VPD effects on bryophyte community composition and Appendix S2. For more detailes about calculating of the reported microclimatic variables see paper section Microclimate data processing  (VPD, Psat and Pair) and Appendix S2 (VPDest). The species composition of the plots is in presence absence scale.;
